# LATER


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Late Comer


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Christena Francis - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
- Member 2: Eshan James - SCMS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

### Project Description
You have to get someplace but there is no way you're getting there early, your wayy too cool to reach on time or you really don't want to go or let's say the host isn't exactly on your good side. How are you gonna be late without an over-complicated explanation of whys?

A map that will take you where you want to go with a slight delay

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Google maps gives you the fastest and shortest route to any destination 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Add an extra few hours to the mix so now it's Google maps that made you late by taking the longest route available.
With an API integration,Google maps is going to be a solution to all the hassles that come with showing up late to an event or destination.
Would you make it on time? Sure with only a 2 hours setback cause "Google maps" showed me the "wrong" route.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Here's a summary of the components used for your Google Maps clone with delay feature:

- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: Leaflet Routing Machine
- Libraries: Leaflet.js for map interactivity, OpenStreetMap for map tiles, Nominatim API for geocoding
- Tools: VS Code, Figma

### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation


1. Clone the Repository  
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using:
   
   git clone <repository-url>
   
2. Navigate to Project Directory  
   Change into the project's directory:
   
   cd <project-directory>
   
3. Install Dependencies  
   If using a package manager (like npm for JavaScript or pip for Python), you would install dependencies with:
   
   npm install
   
   or
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

# Run

1. Start Local Server  
   Use a local server to view the website. For example, with Python:
   bash
   python -m http.server
   
   or, if using Node.js with a package like live-server:
   bash
   live-server .
   

2. Open in Browser  
   After starting the server, open your browser and go to:
   
   http://localhost:8000
   
   or whichever port your server is running on.
